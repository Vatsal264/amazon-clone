Amazon Clone – HTML & CSS (Beginner Project)

A simple Amazon homepage clone created using only HTML and CSS.
This project was built as a beginner-friendly practice to learn the fundamentals of web design, layout structure, and responsive styling.

🚀 Project Overview

This project replicates the UI of Amazon’s homepage, including:

Header & Navigation Bar

Search Bar

Hero Section

Product Boxes / Cards

Footer Section

It is not a functional e-commerce site, but a static front-end layout created to practice HTML + CSS skills.
